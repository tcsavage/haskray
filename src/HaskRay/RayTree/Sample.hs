{-|
The GI sample creates a new ray in a random direction from the intersection point, and samples it again (just like a pixel sample - i.e. lighting, reflection, etc).
When depth = 0, GI sampling only continues while russian roulette allows it to.
Because 'traceGI' is only called for shaded surfaces, we can assume that's all we're going to get and therefore ignore the missing pattern warnings.
