HaskRay
=======

Path tracing* ray tracer implemented in Haskell. (*May or may not support path tracing at this time)

Experimental Branch
-------------------

This program was originally developed for my final year project at the University of Portsmouth. This branch improves and extends the original codebase with features and concepts outside the original project scope.

Some of the improvements being investigated include:

* Flexible Arrow-based material/shading system
* Improved parallism
* Better memory usage and speed
* Full Blender integration (tcsavage/haskray-blender)
* Get path tracing working well enough to be usable
